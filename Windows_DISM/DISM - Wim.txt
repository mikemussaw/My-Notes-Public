DISM - Wim Files
----------------

Capturing A Windows OS Using DISM
---------------------------------
1. Create a folder to store your captured .wim file of the Windows OS.
	A. Create/Place it in your C:\ drive.
	B. Or while capturing the Windows OS image you can place it on your external drive/network share folder.

2. Place Windows 10 OS boot disc into computer.
	A. Access WinPE.
		i. After inputting the Windows 10 boot disc go through the wizard and click "Repair Computer".
		ii. You need to go into the troubleshoot --> command prompt.
3. Command Prompt.
	A. Your working directory will now be "X:\".
		i. This is within the Windows 10 WinPE environment.
	B. Utilize "Disk part" tool within DISM to list/find all drive letters.
		i. "List volume"
			1. WinPE will change your Windows 10 OS image C:\ drive to a NEW drive letter. You need to find out which drive letter that is.
	C. Capture Windows 10 Image. Save to which location?
		i. Save to a network location. (Must be connected via switch)
			1. net use \\IPAddress
				A. Enter User credentials.
			2. dism /capture-image /imagefile:\\"Network\Share\Path\Location\FileName.wim" /capturedir:"NetworkDriveLetter:\" /name:"ImageDescriptionName"
		ii. Save to an external hard drive.
			1. After using "Disk Part" and after listing the volume. Find out what drive letter is your external hard drive and save it there.
			2. dism /capture-image /imagefile:"ExternalHardDriveLetter:\location\folder\CaptureWimFile.wim" /capturedir:"NewDriveLetterOfWin10ImageCdrive:\" /name:"ImageDescriptionName"
		iii. You can place your captured Win 10 OS image (now .wim file) into the same drive of the Win 10 OS image your capturing. (See below)
			1. dism /capture-image /imagefile:"LocationOfWhereYouWantTheCaptureWimFileToBe.wim" /capturedir:"NewDriveLetterOfWin10ImageCdrive:\" /name:"ImageDescriptionName"


Customize Windows 10 OS
-----------------------

**IMPORTANT**: Extract the "install.wim" file out of the mounted ISO image into a folder. 

1. Obtain OS specific edition information on source .wim:
	A. dism /get-wiminfo /wimfile:"driveletter:\sources\install.wim"
		i. You want to know the index of the .wim file. Example= index:3 (Enterprise Ed.)

2. Extract Windows OS specific edition from Source .wim File:
	A. Dism /Export-Image /SourceImageFile:"C:\Location of Source wim\install.wim" /SourceIndex:3 /DestinationImageFile:"C:\Location of desination wim file\install.wim"
		i. MUST include the "\install.wim" in command for the source and destination.
		ii. Even tho you took out index 3 for example from source wim file and look into the "extracted" index .wim file it will start at index 1 again. FYI

3. Mount your source/specific Windows OS .wim file:
	A. dism /Mount-Wim /wimfile:"driveletter:\Location of Source wim file\install.wim" /index:1 /MountDir:"driveletter:\Destination Location\FolderName"
		i. Source WIM file is the from the orginal ISO COPIED to local drive. Then, picking a version of OS to mount.
		ii. The "Mount" folder MUST exist already before doing command above.
		iii. If you want to re-mount specific Windows OS edition to mounting folder. That specific edition is now index 1 after pulling out from source.

4. Get settings for Mounted Windows .wim file:
	A. Dism /Get-MountedImageInfo
		i. This will only work if you have a mounted .wim file already.
		ii. I use this command on the source (ISO) install.wim file to look at the read/write permissions, so I can modify to a custom .wim file.

**Optional**:
-------------
Add .Net Framework to mounted .Wim file:
1. dism /Image:"driveletter:\Location of wim mounted folder" /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:NetFx3 /All /LimitAccess /Source:"driveletter:\sources\sxs"
	A. Make a copy of your specific OS edition wim file to another folder and modify the extra copy.  
	B. Mount orginal ISO file of your Windows OS to a drive and add the path of wim to the "/Source:" portion of this command above.
	C.  In sum, your mounting your custom .wim file to a folder and orginal ISO of the Window OS to a drive. Your using the mounted ISO as a source to get the .net and injecting it into your mounted folder of your custom wim file.

Verify which Windows Updates are installed:
1. Dism /Get-Packages /image:"driveletter:\MountedFolderName"
	A. Use " | clip" at the end of the command to copy to clipboard and paste it in a text document.
	B. Inject Windows OS updates into WIM file.
		i. dism /Image:"driverletter:\MountedFolderName" /LogPath:"AddYourDesktopForLogs.log" /Add-Package /PackagePath:"driveletter:\PathToKBUpdate.msu"

Verify which Windows drivers are installed:
1. dism /image:"driveletter:\MountedFolderName" /Get-Drivers
	A. Use " | clip" at the end of the command to copy to clipboard and paste it in a text document.

Verify which Windows Appx's are installed:
1. dism /image:"driveletter:\MountedFolderName" /Get-ProvisionedAppxPackages
	A. Use " | clip" at the end of the command to copy to clipboard and paste it in a text document.
	B. Use this command below to remove App's.
		i. Dism /Image:"driveletter:\MountedFolderName" /Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage /PackageName:"Name of Package"
